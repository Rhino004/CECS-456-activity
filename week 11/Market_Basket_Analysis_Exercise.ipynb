    "# üß™ Class Exercise: Discovering Shopping Patterns with Association Rule Mining\n",
    "\n",
    "## üéØ Objective:\n",
    "You will explore a real-world transactional dataset using **association rule mining** and the **Apriori algorithm**. Your goal is to uncover relationships between items frequently bought together in a grocery store setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üßæ Dataset: `Market_Basket_Optimisation.csv`\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each row = one shopping basket (transaction)  \n",
    "- Each column = an item purchased  \n",
    "- There are up to 20 items per transaction  \n",
    "- Empty cells mean fewer items were purchased in that transaction  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üìò Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you begin, make sure you understand these important terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Term        | Definition |\n",
    "|-------------|------------|\n",
    "| **Support** | The proportion of transactions that contain a specific itemset. It tells you how frequent an item or item combination is. |\n",
    "| **Confidence** | The likelihood that item **B** is purchased **when item A is purchased**. It measures the reliability of the rule. |\n",
    "| **Lift** | The ratio of observed support to what would be expected if **A** and **B** were independent. Lift > 1 means the rule is stronger than chance. |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:  \n",
    "If `mineral water ‚Üí green tea` has:  \n",
    "- **Support = 0.01** ‚Üí in 1% of all transactions, both were bought  \n",
    "- **Confidence = 0.3** ‚Üí in 30% of purchases with mineral water, green tea was also bought  \n",
    "- **Lift = 3** ‚Üí customers are 3x more likely to buy green tea if they buy mineral water  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üß∞ Requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure you have these Python packages installed:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install pandas apyori\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ‚úÖ Tasks & Hints\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîπ Task 1: Load the Data\n",
    "**Hint:** Use `pandas` to read the CSV file. Since there is no header row, remember to set `header=None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîπ Task 2: Convert the Dataset into Transactions\n",
    "**Hint:** You'll need to loop through each row of the DataFrame and extract the non-empty items (filter out missing values).  \n",
    "Each transaction should be a list of items.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîπ Task 3: Apply the Apriori Algorithm\n",
    "**Hint:** Use the `apriori()` function from the `apyori` library. You‚Äôll need to provide:\n",
    "- The list of transactions\n",
    "- Minimum support (e.g., 0.003)\n",
    "- Minimum confidence (e.g., 0.2)\n",
    "- Minimum lift (e.g., 3)\n",
    "- Set `min_length` and `max_length` to 2 to look for 2-item rules only\n",
    "\n",
    "The output will be a generator of rules ‚Äî convert it to a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîπ Task 4: Interpret the Rules\n",
    "**Hint:** Each rule object contains:\n",
    "- The **items** involved in the rule\n",
    "- The **support** of the itemset\n",
    "- The **confidence** and **lift** values in the `.ordered_statistics` attribute\n",
    "\n",
    "Extract this information and store it in a structured format like a table or DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîπ Task 5: Analyze and Answer\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer the following based on your results:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Pick a rule and explain what its **support**, **confidence**, and **lift** mean.\n",
    "2. Filter the rules to find those with **lift > 4**. How many such rules are there?\n",
    "3. Which rule has the **highest confidence**?\n",
    "4. As a store manager, how could you use these insights for **product placement** or **promotions**?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ‚≠ê Bonus Challenge (Optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a **bar chart** showing the lift of the top 10 rules.  \n",
    "**Hint:** Use `matplotlib.pyplot` and sort your rules by lift value.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üìù Deliverables\n",
    "\n",
    "Submit the following:\n",
    "- Your Python code (Jupyter notebook or `.py` file)\n",
    "- A brief explanation (1-2 paragraphs) interpreting your results\n",
    "- Answers to the written questions\n"
